* Added .reserve() to a few variables
* seqgen streams new letters directly to output, not keeping entire new
sequence in memory
* seqgen version bumped to v1.1
* Dropped -p option for countlets
* countlets has a new -a option, allowing to specify alphabet to prevent
loading entire sequence into memory (at the cost of speed for higher k)
* countlets version bumped to v1.1
* countfa now reads one char at a time, version bumped to v1.1

* shuffler -f now inserts newlines every 80 characters
* Streamlined shuffler internals: sequences in fasta files are loaded,
shuffled and output one at a time instead of keeping the entire file in
memory
