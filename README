Installation
------------

Enter the directory and run:

    make

The following binaries are created:

    bin/countlets
    bin/shuffler

Run these without any arguments or with the -h flag to see usage.

countlets
---------

This utility counts the total number of k-lets in the input sequence.

    bin/./countlets -k 1 -i example/sequence.txt

        A 17384
        C 8081
        G 7583
        T 16952


shuffler
--------

Shuffles an input sequence using one of two methods. The default, linear,
splits the sequence every k letters before shuffling these around.

See:

    AAACAGAT

After splitting:

    AA AC AG AT
    1  2  3  4

The k-let indices are shuffled, and the shuffled sequence reassembled from
the split k-lets by their new index position. Any remainder letters which do
not fit in a full k-let are left at the end.

The markov method works by first getting the total number of all possible
k-lets. Following this, a new sequence (of equal length) is created. Every new
letter is chosen based on the probability of that letter (and the last k - 1
letters) appearing in a k-let in the original sequence.
